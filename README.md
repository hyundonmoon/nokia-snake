# Nokia-Snake

<h2>Description</h2>

I recently came across an interesting way of doing animation in JavaScript called requestAnimationFrame. After reading up on it, I felt that I needed to get some hands-on practice to really understand it.

The code found here is a modification of the code written by @WebDevSimplified. I watched his video on recreating the Snake game with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and understood it well enough to implement it on my own without having to look at his work.

In the future, I'd like to add a multiplayer feature to the game with Socket.io.
